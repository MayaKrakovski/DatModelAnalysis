July
20 Validation experiments (one session good, one not good)
10 Validation experiments (one session with weights, one without)

Models:
Model 2 – not good results, Evaluate with the other two -> need to summarize all results.
Fix Model:
•	New standardization – of raw data, based on the range of each experiment.
    	Bad results on the old data.. ?
•	Try standardization based only on good performances
•	Look into the repetition division again
•	Calc models based on new data
•	Calculate angels again of old data (based on 3d angle calculation) – and than look into model with 3 exercises and all exercises?
•	Remove features based on size (like mean, rep count..)
•	Labeling – maybe label again?
